## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is the Duke University Greek Life Data Set. The dataset was originally published at [Greek-Life-Demographics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chrissymbeck/Greek-Life-Demographics/master/Greek_Data_Duke_Class_of_2018.csv), this dataset contains the data The Chronicle used to analyze trends between those who do and don't join Greek life at Duke.

## Setup

To run the website download the code from github using `git clone` and clone the repository into your local computer. After cloning the repository `cd` into project workspace,  and run `npm install` to download the necessary node packages required to run the website. Once the node packages are done installing, use the command `npm start` on your terminal to run the project on your `localhost:3000`

## Project

When you first open the project the website takes you to the home page where you can interact with the three bottom navigation tabs to get more information about the project. The three bottom navigation tabs are : Project, About the Data and Raw Data. The project page contains information about the project and is a copy this READMe file. When you click on About the data tab it gives you information about the data and links to the original dataset.

After getting some information about the data you can choose which data visualization you want to visualize, you can choose any from the top bar. The Heatmap visualization provides a heatmap of the United States with a interactive color legend to explore where different students come from at Duke. The size of the circle represent the highschool price of different students.
